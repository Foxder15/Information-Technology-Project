# ABSTRACT

In the world wide web and the modern world today, there are a huge applications and a variety of information inside those applications. The data mining become more crucial which support businesses to collect and analyze to provide optimal solutions for raising the profit and enormous advantages real-life.  In data science, there are a lot of field about data mining like Pattern Mining, Graph Mining, Bioinformatics Data Mining and so on.

In this report, we introduce the utility-driven pattern mining and analyze deeply into high-utility data mining from a transaction database.  Simply, utility mining algorithms will exploit and solve all qualified patterns which satisfy a given minimum utility threshold.  But the big problem from these algorithms, a big number of qualified results is not interpretable and not easy to understand. Moreover, users have to spend much of time to find the minimum utility threshold from even hundred thousands values. Top-k high-utility itemset mining has been studied to give a solution to the tough issue. 

Our presentation is that we show an efficient algorithm name TopHUI for finding Top-K high utility itemsets from transaction database and utilize both negative and positive transactional values, an algorithm actually demonstrates the accurate top k highest utilities from huge results. We also give and try the positive and negative utility list (PNU-list) to store positive, negative and remaining utility. Some threshold raising strategies and pruning strategies are tried to reduce the space of data. In the last part, we conduct some experiments on both real-life and synthetic datasets and compare the effectiveness and efficiency of algorithms.

# 1. INTRODUCTION

Introduction: 
	In the era of continuously advancing technology, data intelligence is crucial for business. Data intelligence is the technique which has revealed itself the extraordinary ability to extract the meaning from data with wide applications. 
The technique support business to interact and dissect a variety of data. The era of big data, a lot of hidden and useful information from rich data is important for human being. Exposing these rich data will make a big profit or advantages for corporation, healthcare, scientific research and education. Until now, there are many data mining algorithms have been developed for analysis several types of information. There are many techniques in the data mining field and in this report, we will concentrate on pattern mining field like frequent pattern mining, sequential pattern mining, and the primary is utility-driven pattern mining. 
	Moving to the past, pattern mining algorithms have been developed for finding frequency or support of objects or items but these are not enough. In reality, item or object also has its weight, profit, cost or risk and the reason has led to the improvement of study about pattern mining. A lot of algorithms have been created and these allow more valuable information to be exposed than previous pattern mining algorithms. 
	The Utility-driven mining framework has been developed, called high-utility itemset mining (HUIM) algorithms. This method focuses on two factors, one is the unit utility which is also called external utility and another is quantity, be also called internal utility. And setting the minimum utility threshold value, calculating the utility of itemsets from two factors easily. If the derived utility value is greater than the threshold in advance, we can conclude the itemsets is high-utility itemsets (HUIs)
	The well-known Two-Phase algorithm has been developed for finding HUIs, the method firstly find the upper bound on the utility of itemsets and then trim most of the unqualified itemsets without further calculating their supersets. And referring from Two-Phase, several advanced methods have been created like UP-growth, HUI-Miner and so on. Up to now, there are many algorithms of utility mining have been proposed. 
	But the problem has raised, the pattern mining task in a new database has become tough due to discovering a suitable and satisfying minimum utility threshold. To address, the top K mining has been applied, it will return how many pattern user wants. We just discover K patterns which have the highest utility. In the field of utility mining, because several number of results of HUIM and these are not interpretable, addition, more time-consuming and difficult for users to set a proper minimum utility threshold, the TKU, TKO, kHMC and THUI have been proposed to solve the interesting problem. Top-K utility mining algorithms can handle the issue of a huge results of traditional HUIM algorithms. 
	In a general utility mining framework, above methods don't work with the domain of negative utility values such as top-k high-utility itemsets mining algorithm (THUI) which method will find top k highest utility patterns with raising minimum threshold strategies and pruning space strategies but only the positive utility list is used to assess the utility contribution of patterns but the negative utility values is commonly seen in the real-life. That so, the problem of Top-K HUIs with positive and negative has been designed and the top k high-utility itemsets mining with negative utility algorithms (TopHUI) which is the advance of THUI algorithms has been proposed. 
	Overall, in this research, we will expose about the advance of THUI, TopHUI, an efficient and scalable exploration algorithms, it is flexible method for mining top-k HUIs with negative and positive utility. we present a TopHUI for mining top-k high-utility itemsets from transactional databases that contain both positive and negative utility values. And to reduce the amount of access the database, the positive and negative utility-list (PNU-List) is utilized in TopHUI. Using many minimum utility threshold raising strategies like RIU, RTU and RUC, these will quickly raise the minimum utility of the set of potential Top-k HUIs. Some pruning strategies are used to reduce the searching space, calculate the actual utilities of itemsets and their upper-bounds on utility in linear time. 
	Our plan is that we work with related problem. Firstly, we explain HUMI, TopHUI and solve them with negative utility, research and show an efficient TopHUI algorithm. Secondly, some key word like PNU-List, pruning strategies and raising minimum threshold utility value will be shown and complete the details of TopHUI. Thirdly, the experiment will be conducted on transactional databases with both negative and positive utility. Finally, we try to demonstrate the comparation of TopHUI and THUI, and try to compare TopHUI with another method in the same problem and summarized our research. 
2. Related work: 
	In this section, there are three part, transactional database for presentation about the used database, high-utility pattern mining using top-K and the details about high-utility pattern mining with negative utility (TopHUI). 
	2.1. Transactional Databases
		In this report, our experiment will be conducted on transactional database, that is a table which records all a transaction from customer in a store, a bank and so on. Each transaction will store a set of items bought by a customer. To depend on a list of transactions, we will figure out many itemsets of items and their utility in each transaction. Recording and gathering would serve to find top-K HUIs from transactional databases. We will define and explain more details in an advanced part. 
	2.2. High-utility pattern mining using top-K (HUIM and THUI)
		In the data mining field, pattern mining is the one of basic techniques. In the past, frequent pattern mining (FPM) was proposed by Agrawal in 1993 but the aiming of this mining technique is that discover the frequent itemsets, all itemsets of items appearing  in at least minimum support threshold. But the support-confidence based pattern mining framework show its limitation. In reality, one item or object also has other states like weight, cost, risk and more, the FPM only find itemsets appearing many times or in at least min support parameter. The return results will point out many important limitations, there are many results (itemsets) not interesting, it may be invaluable or low value. In the transactions, so much worth item but in the FPM, all items are considered as equally important. To find the interesting, utility-driven pattern mining was proposed. 
		Several utility mining algorithms was proposed like HUIM, HUI-Miner, FHM, HUP-growth and Two-Phase. A limitation is still here, how to user set a minimum utility threshold and each transactional databases, we must find a new minimum utility threshold. Developing effective and efficient algorithms for mining high-utility patterns have been studied and the top-k algorithms was proposed for mining. the HUIM algorithms with a min utility threshold is hard but HUIM with top-K without setting a min utility threshold are effective and efficient. In 2012, Wu et al firstly introduced the Top-K HUI mining framework with TKU algorithms. There are many Top-K HUI algorithms was proposed, more effective the TKO, REPT and KHMC algorithms. Top-K HUIs mining will discover top k
itemsets which have high-utility in the range of K in transactional databases. To generate the potential Top-K HUI without setting a minimum utility threshold, using threshold raising strategies is needed for quickly raising the minimum utility threshold and downing a space searching, some pruning strategies are added to find the upper bound of itemset. Now, the best Top-K HUIs algorithm has been developed which is named THUI. THUI show more scalable and highly effective to return results than others.
